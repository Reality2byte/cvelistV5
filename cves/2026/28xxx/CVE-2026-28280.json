A user with query-level permissions can inject arbitrary JavaScript via the query parameter when running an on-demand query. The payload is stored and executes in the browser of any user (including administrators) who visits the query list page. This can be chained with CSRF token extraction to escalate privileges and take actions as the logged in user. An attacker with query-level permissions (the lowest privilege tier) can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of all users who view the query list. Depending on their level of access, it can lead to full platform compromise if an administrator executes the payload. The issue is fixed in osctrl `v0.5.0`. As a workaround, restrict query-level permissions to trusted users, monitor query list for suspicious payloads, and/or review osctrl user accounts for unauthorized administrators."
