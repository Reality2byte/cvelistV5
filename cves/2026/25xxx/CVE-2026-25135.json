Versions prior to 8.0.0 have an information disclosure vulnerability that leaks the entire contact information for all users, organizations, and patients in the system to anyone who has the system/(Group,Patient,*).$export operation and system/Location.read capabilities.  This vulnerability will impact OpenEMR versions since 2023. This disclosure will only occur in extremely high trust environments as it requires using a confidential client with secure key exchange that requires an administrator to enable and grant permission before the app can even be used. This will typically only occur in server-server communication across trusted clients that already have established legal agreements. Version 8.0.0 contains a patch. As a workaround, disable clients that have the vulnerable scopes and only allow clients that do not have the system/Location.read scope until a fix has been deployed."
