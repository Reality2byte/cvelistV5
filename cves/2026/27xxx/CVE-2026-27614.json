In versions prior to 2.0.13, an unauthenticated attacker who can submit events to a Bugsink project can store arbitrary JavaScript in an event. The payload executes only if a user explicitly views the affected Stacktrace in the web UI. When Pygments returns more lines than it was given (a known upstream quirk that triggers with Ruby heredoc-style input), `_pygmentize_lines()` in `theme/templatetags/issues.py:75-77` falls back to returning the raw input lines. `mark_safe()` at line 111-113 is then applied unconditionally - including to those unsanitized raw lines. Since DSN endpoints are public by Sentry protocol, no account is needed to inject. The payload sits in the database until an admin looks at the event. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker to be able to submit events to the project (i.e. knows the DSN or can access a client that uses it), the Bugsink ingest endpoint is reachable to the attacker, and an administrator explicitly views the crafted event in the UI. Under those conditions, the attacker can execute JavaScript in the administrator’s browser and act with that user’s privileges within Bugsink. Version 2.0.13 fixes the vulnerability."
